Programming has recently become my hobby and main free time interest as it has been growing on me for last several months. I have started some courses on Frontend (HTML, CSS and JS) recently but applying for Codecademy I paused that path and started learning C#. I found programming a pleasing and fulfilling activity, especially when code, made from scratch, starts to work. Coding also stimulates my creativity and I find it quite satisfying. 

As late Steve Jobs once said: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.” I think programming might be 'the thing' in my case...

And last but not least - my Hangman game. It is as simple as it only could be, based on my current best knowledge, which is derived from online tutorials (as I didn't want any professional programmer to do the job for me. That would not be fair at all). I need to add that about three days ago I didn't know anything about C# and today I committed some simple code, totally on my own. The code is working, which makes me quite happy, however it is simple as hell ;) and for sure needs optimization and development. But it is as it is. ;) Having some more time to learn, I would create a way better and complete game.
